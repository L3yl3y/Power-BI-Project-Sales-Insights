So far in this project I have downloaded Parallels Desktop to enable Windows on my Mac by creating a virtual machine (VM) - this enables me to run the Windows application Power BI Desktop. I then proceeded to download mySQL server and mySQL Workbench, with which I'd then found a large amount of sales data (online) in order to run some fun little queries. At first I had tinkered about with rather basic SQL queries (SUM, WHERE, JOIN), and then it evolved into me wanting to connect power BI to the same SQL database - as well as some data cleaning (it was warranted due to their being negative values and inconsistent currency across product sales).

So power BI has now connected to mySQL (server: 127.0.0.1:3306 localhost) and has pulled all the records from the file tables into its power BI environment - I can now transform this data. (Note reports are nothing but the BI dashboard visualisations). I first began learning about the features of power BI - what's rather interesting to witness is this data model (relationship between different tables). It was established that there was a relationship between sales.products, sales.transactions, and sales.customers. Some might need manual relationship establishment using drag and drop. Apparently I had done a star schema (fact table vs dimension table)(new concept for myself).
