So far in this project I have started by downloading mySQL server and mySQL Workbench (on Mac). From there, I had gone out to download a large amount of sales data (online) in order to run my queries. At first I had tinkered about with rather basic SQL queries (SUM, WHERE, JOIN), and then it evolved into me wanting to connect power BI to the same SQL database - as well as some data cleaning (it was warranted due to their being negative values and inconsistent currency across product sales).

I have downloaded Parallels Desktop to enable Windows on my Mac by creating a virtual machine (VM) - as this enables me to run the Windows application Power BI Desktop. I re-downloaded mySQL server and mySQL Workbench to make it windows compatible.
